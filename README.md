# CPP-Heapsort-Algorithm
Visual Studio C++ algorithm that sorts a group of objects using a minimum-oriented priority queue built off a binary heap. The priority queue can be templated to take generic types.

Made for my first-year algorithms module in the Games Programming course at Teesside University.
